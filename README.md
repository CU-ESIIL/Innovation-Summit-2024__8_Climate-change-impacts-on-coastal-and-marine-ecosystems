# Coastal Resilience Champions: The many effects of climate change on coastal areas

Welcome to the Coastal Resilience repository, an integral part of ESIIL and Earth Lab's Forest Carbon Codefest. This repository is the central hub for our team, encompassing our project overview, team member information, codebase, and more...


## Our Project
Climate change impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems. How can we monitor/predict coastal adnd marine ecosystem resilence under climate change. 

Focus on using data to monitor baseline conditions (ecosystem services/natures contributions to people) and predicting changes to those services.  Look at both human and ecosystem dimensions of coastal areas.

# Data Sources
Data that shows extent of marsh area
National Estuary Reserch Reserve system - e.g., Sapillo Island
ArcGIS (GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems)
Sentinel2 Multispectral Data on AWS
EPA water quality
NOAA Digital Coast
LiDAR

final choices:
NERR data - water quality, to define conditions of coastal areas, 
ArcGIS - GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems to show what land cover types/vegetation classes
