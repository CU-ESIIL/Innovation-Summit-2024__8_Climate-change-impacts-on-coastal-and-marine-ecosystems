## Research Question: Innovation for Inclusion or Computation (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Write the research question your team selected in the space below. Feel free to revise the original question.

- Climate change impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems: How can we monitor/predict coastal adnd marine ecosystem resilence under climate change?
We are focusing on the use of data to monitor baseline conditions of tidal marsh ecosystems in the southeastern US and assess how those conditions have changed in the recent past. We will assess the impacts of these changes on local ecosystems and communities and suggest ways coastal ecosystems can prepare, adapt, and become more resilient to future changes.


## Project Title (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Craft a catchy title for your team’s project. Think of something that would grab attention at a conference or in a headline.

- Coastal Resilience: Rising with Sea Level


## Promoting Resilience and Adaptation
Describe how your proposed project aligns with the Summit's themes of resilience and adaptation. Please provide 1-2 sentences that clearly connect your project's goals or methods to these themes.

## Choosing Big Data Sets
Explore potential data sets for your project's topic from the [data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/). List your options below, organizing them by whether they represent the system you're studying (e.g., deciduous forests) or the disruption to it (e.g., wildfire). Then discuss your choices and indicate your final selections.

### Draft Potential Data Sets
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted:**
    - NERR monitoring
    - C-CAP (coastal land cover change)
    
    - LANDFIRE/GAP (landcover/vegetation)
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter:**
    - NOAA Digital coast (SLR)
    - LiDAR DEMs

### Final Choice
  - **System Being Perturbed/Disrupted (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]
  - **Perturbator/Disrupter (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]



## Brief Check-in: Definition of Resilience (approx. 5 mins)
Below is a working definition of the word "Resilience" for the Summit. Please edit the definition below based on your earlier discussion and chosen project.

*"Resilience is the capacity of a system, community, organization, or individual to absorb stress, recover from disruptions, adapt to change, and continue to develop and thrive."*
